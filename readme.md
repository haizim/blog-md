# Markdown Blog

Database-less blog. Instead, I use markdown file to store blog's articles.

### How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. List your blog's articles in `blog.json`
3. Place your blog's articles as markdown file in `article` directory
4. Name your markdown file as your article's slug

### Made with

- Alpine JS : I want to migrate from Livewire to Alpine. So, I made this project as an excercise hehe
- Showdown JS : Main character of this project. It converts markdown to HTML
- Tailwind : We love Tailwind <3
